### Description

Employee attrition refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving their jobs within a company. This can occur due to various reasons such as dissatisfaction with work, seeking better opportunities, or personal reasons. Understanding employee attrition is crucial for organizations to retain talent and maintain productivity.

In this project, I analyze a dataset containing data from nearly 1500 former and current IBM employees. 

The dataset includes information relevant to job satisfaction, salary, demographics, work-life balance, and other factors.

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I aim to gain insights into the factors that contribute to employee attrition and identify demographics or work-related aspects that are associated with higher attrition rates.

### Conclusion

Overall, 16% of employees left the company. 

Most of the individuals who left their jobs were from the Human Resources department.

Employees aged between 26 and 35, especially those around 29 and 31 years old, had the highest attrition rates.

This age group could benefit from targeted efforts to improve retention.

While job satisfaction alone didn't strongly predict attrition, employees who rated their work-life balance as moderate (3 out of 4) were more likely to leave. 

This highlights the need to enhance work-life balance initiatives,       particularly for those with         moderate ratings, to boost retention and employee happiness.

The random forest classifier achieved a testing accuracy of approximately 86.4%.

This indicates that the model performed well in predicting employee attrition. 

With further refinement, this predictive tool could effectively support HR strategies aimed at understanding and mitigating attrition.
