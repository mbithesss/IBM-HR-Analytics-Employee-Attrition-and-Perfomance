### Description

Employee attrition refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving their jobs within a company. This can occur due to various reasons such as dissatisfaction with work, seeking better opportunities, or personal reasons. Understanding employee attrition is crucial for organizations to retain talent and maintain productivity.

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing data from nearly 1500 former and current IBM employees. The dataset includes information relevant to job satisfaction, salary, demographics, work-life balance, and other factors. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we aim to gain insights into the factors that contribute to employee attrition and identify demographics or work-related aspects that are associated with higher attrition rates.
